## Polyfill extras

The polyfilled `CustomElementsRegistry` provides an additional property `polyfilled` set to `true`.

```js
// when natively supported
console.log(window.customElements.polyfilled) // => undefined

// when polyfilled
console.log(window.customElements.polyfilled) // => true
```


## Install Dependencies
```bash
make deps
```

## Building
```bash
make
```

## Building for production
Setting the `BUILD_ENV` environment variable to `production` will disable sourcmaps and cause the javascript to be minified.
It's generally a good idea to run `make clean` before building for production.

```bash
BUILD_ENV=release make
```

## Cleanup built files
```bash
make clean
```
