## Install Dependencies
```bash
make deps
```

## Building
```bash
make
```

## Building for production
Setting the environment variable NODE_ENV to production will disable sourcmaps and cause the javascript to be minified.
It's generally a good idea to run `make clean` before building for production.

```bash
NODE_ENV=production make
```

## Cleanup built files
```bash
make clean
```
